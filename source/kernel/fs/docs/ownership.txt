All public functions in the fs folder must be called with ownership of each
argument as required by the function. This means the caller must hold
a valid reference to every argument for the entire duration of the function call.
Violation of this rule will lead to memory corruption or deadlock.

Ownership:
1) Child dentry holds reference (pins) parent dentry, but not the other way
around. So, this means that tree is always full and is destructed from leaf
nodes to parent nodes - tree never have gaps. In other words - if you hold
reference to child, you can safely climb up by atomically obtaining parent
references and incrementing their reference counts.
